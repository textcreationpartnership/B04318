            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

And seing the evidence taken by the Lords, and other members of the Commission, which His Majesty was most graciously pleased to grant for enquiring into that affair, hath cleared to the Parliament, That after com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting of the foresaid Massacre, the poor Petitioners were most ravenously plundered of all that was necessary for the sustentation of their lives, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, all their Clothes, Money, Houses, &amp; Plenishing, all burned destroyed or taken away, that the Soldiers did Drive no fewer than five hundred Horses, fourteen or fifteen hundred Cows, and many more Sheep and Goats; And that it is a proper occasion for His Majesty, and the Estates Assembled in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament to give a full Vindication of their Justice, &amp; freeing the Publick from the least Imputation which may be cast thereon by Foraign Enemies on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of so unexampled an Action and that it is worthy of that Honour and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice which His Majestie and the Estates have been pleased to shevv to the World vvith relation to that Affair, to relieve the necessity of the poor Petitioners, and to save them and their exposed Widovvs and Orphans from Starving, and al the miserys of the extreamest Poverty to vvhich they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitably lyable; unless His Majesty and the Estates provide them a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy.</p>
